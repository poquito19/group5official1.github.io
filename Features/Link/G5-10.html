        <p class="lead">Database, also called electronic database, any collection of data, or information, that is specially organized for rapid search and retrieval by a computer. Databases are structured to facilitate the storage, retrieval, modification, and deletion of data in conjunction with various data-processing operations. A database management system (DBMS) extracts information from the database in response to queries.</p>

        <h3>Topics:</h3><br>
	<p><b>Database Size and Complexity</b><br>
	» A Personal database is designed for use by a single person on a single computer. Such a database usually has a rather simple structure and a relatively small size.
<br>
» A Departmental or workgroup database is used by the members of a single department or workgroup within an organization. This type of database is generally larger than a personal database and is necessarily more complex; such a database must handle multiple users trying to access the same data at the same time.
<br>
» An Enterprise database can be huge. Enterprise databases may model the critical information flow of entire large organizations.

        <p><b> Information Management</b><br>
		» is the process of collecting, storing, and organizing data in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and use. Its purpose is to ensure that the right information is available to the right people at the right time, in order to facilitate decision-making and support the efficient operation of an organization.

</p><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p><b>Database Management System(DBMS)</b><br>
		» A sequential access collection is a list that stores its elements in sequential order. We call this
        type of collection a linear list. Linear lists are not limited by size when they are created, meaning
        are referenced by their position, as shown in Figure 1.2. The first element of a linear list is at the
        front of the list and the last element is at the rear of the list.</p><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p><b>Data Modeling</b><br>
        	» Data modeling is the process of creating a data model.
Throughout the process, developers will work closely
with stakeholders (i.e., potential users of the
to-be-created systems). Data modeling begins with
collecting information about business requirements
and rules from stakeholders. These principles are then
converted into data structures, which are used to
create a concrete database design.

        <p class="lead">Animation is the art of presenting still photographs with the help of various computer-based techniques in a
manner which gives an impression to the viewer that it is running like a film. It could be a mixed version of multimedia
text, graphic art, sound, animation and video sourced through computer or some other electronic media. Multimedia
has become an inevitable part of any presentation. It has found a variety of applications right from entertainment to
education. The evolution of internet has also increased the demand for multimedia content.</p>

<h3>Topics:</h3><br>
	<p><b>Proximity</b><br>
		» Proximity is all about using visual space to show relationships in your content. Groups that are NOT related to
each other should be separated to visually emphasize their lack of a relationship. All in all, this makes your work easier
to understand at a glance, whether it's purely text or something more visual.
		</p><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p><b>White space</b><br>
        »	White space is an important part of every composition. Now, this doesn't mean literal white space; it just means
negative space, like the spaces between your content, between lines, and even the outer margins. There's no one way
to use white space correctly, but it's good to understand its purpose. White space helps you define and separate
different sections; it gives your content room to breathe. If your work ever starts to feel cluttered or uncomfortable, a
little white space might be just what the doctor ordered.
		</p><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p><b>Alignment</b><br>
       » 	Alignment is something you deal with all the time, even if you don't realize it. Whenever you type an email or
create a document, the text is aligned automatically. When aligning objects by yourself (for instance, images or separate
text boxes), getting it right can be tricky. The most important thing is to be consistent. It might help to imagine your
content arranged inside of a grid. It's this attention to detail that makes the composition easier to navigate. Without
consistent alignment, your work could start to feel disorganized.

		</p><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p><b>Contrast</b><br>
        »	Contrast simply means that one item is different from
another. In layout and composition, contrast can help you do
many things, like catch the reader's eye, create emphasis, or call
attention to something important.
To create contrast in the given example, we've used color,
more than one style of text, and objects of differing sizes. This
makes the design more dynamic and, therefore, more effective at
communicating its message.
		</p><br>
        <hr><br>

         <p><b>Repetition</b><br>
        »	Repetition is a reminder that every project should have a consistent look and feel. This means finding ways to
reinforce your design by repeating or echoing certain elements. For instance, if you have a specific color palette, look
for ways to carry it through. If you've chosen a special header style, use it every time.
It's not just for aesthetic reasons—being consistent can also make your work easier to read. When viewers
know what to expect, they can relax and focus on the content.

        <h2 class="featurette-heading fw-normal lh-1">MobApp</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">A mobile application, most commonly known as an app, is a kind of application software intended to run on a mobile phone, for example, a smartphone or tablet PC. Mobile applications often serve to furnish clients with comparable administrations to those got on PCs. Apps are by and large small, individual software units with restricted capacity. This utilization of application programming was initially advocated by Apple Inc. also, its App Store, which offers a huge number of uses for the iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch. </p>

<h3>Topics:</h3><br>
	<p><b>Xamarin</b><br>
	»	It is a framework for creating a C#-based, cross-platform mobile application. A variety of
frameworks are available for cross-platform app development. JavaScript and HTML are both used. Using JS libraries, we
may create apps that function similarly to websites for mobile apps with the aid of this framework. The packaging of the
website creates the impression that it is a native app.

        <p><b>Prototyping</b><br>
       » 	Prototyping is an experimental process where design teams implement ideas into
tangible forms from paper to digital. Teams build prototypes of varying degrees of fidelity to capture design concepts
and test on users. With prototypes, you can refine and validate your designs so your brand can release the right
products.
	</p><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p><b>Android SDK Manager</b><br>
       » 	Android uses multiple Android API level settings to determine your app's compatibility across the various versions of
Android (for more information about Android API levels, see Understanding Android API Levels). Depending on what
Android API level(s) you want to target, you may need to download and install additional Android SDK components.
Besides, you may need to install optional tools and emulator images provided in the Android SDK. To do this, use the
Android SDK Manager. You can launch the Android SDK Manager by clicking Tools > Android > Android SDK Manager.
		</p><br>
        <hr><br>

        <p><b>Android Emulator</b><br>
       » 	The Android Emulator can be a helpful tool to develop and test a XAMARIN.Android app. For example, a physical device
such as a tablet may not be readily available during development, or a developer may want to run some integration tests
on their computer before committing code.
